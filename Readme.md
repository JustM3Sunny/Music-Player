# Sunny's Advanced Music Player üéµ

### **Project Description** üìú

This project is a simple yet advanced music player built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  It allows users to upload and play audio files directly from their computer. The player includes features like play/pause, next/previous song controls, shuffle, repeat, volume control, and a dynamic playlist.  It's useful for anyone who wants a basic, customizable music player without relying on external services or complex applications.  The sleek dark mode design adds to the user experience.


### **Installation Instructions** üíæ

1. **Save the code:** Save the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code as separate files (e.g., `index.html`, `style.css`, though CSS is embedded in this example, and you don't need to save it separately).  Make sure the files are in the same directory.  You will also need a `favicon.ico` file in that same directory.  A simple 16x16 pixel image will suffice.
2. **Open in browser:** Open the `index.html` file in your web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.).


### **Features** ‚ú®

* **Audio Playback:** Play, pause, skip to the next/previous song.
* **Dynamic Playlist:**  Displays uploaded songs in a scrollable playlist. Clicking a song in the playlist will play that song.
* **Shuffle Mode:** Randomly play songs from the playlist.
* **Repeat Mode:** Repeat the current song or the entire playlist.
* **Volume Control:** Adjust the volume using a slider.
* **Song Information:** Displays the title and artist of the currently playing song.
* **File Upload:** Upload multiple audio files (.mp3, .wav, etc.) at once.
* **Rotating Artwork:**  A visually appealing rotating disk graphic.
* **Dark Mode:** The player uses a modern dark theme.
